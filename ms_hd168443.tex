\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}
\indent The number of known exoplanets planets has growing rapidly in the last decade, with over 550 confirmed exoplanets known to date\footnote{exoplanet.eu}. While most of these confirmed planets have been discovered using radial velocity techniques, the number of known transiting planets has increased rapidly due to dedicated transit survey like the space based   Kepler  \citep{Borucki11} and CoRoT \citet{Barge08} missions, and ground based transit searches like Hungarian Automated Telescope Network (HATNet)\citet{Bakos04} , SuperWASP \cite{Pollacco06}, and XO \citep{McCullough05}. The price for efficient operation of  these wide-field transit surveys, though, is that most of the sample stars tend to be fainter than those being surveyed by radial velocity. Of the over hundred transiting planet hosts known, the sample of bright stars  (V$<$9) with transiting planets is still limited to only seven stars:  HD209458 \citep{Charbonneau00, Henry00}, HD189733 \citep{Bouchy05} ,HD149026 \citep{Sato05}, HD17156 \citep{Barbieri07}, HD80606 \citep{Moutou09, Fossey09}, all of which were first discovered by radial velocity surveys, and WASP-33b and HAT-2b which were discovered by transit surveys and confirmed with radial velocity followup. The value of thest bright transiting planets hosts cannot be overstated. Even with the largest ground based telescopes, transmission spectroscopy to probe the atmopsheres of these exoplanets has largely only been accomplished for the brightest targets. Using high-resolution spectroscopy on 8-10m telescopes \citet{Redfield08}  and \citet{Snellen08} detected sodium absorption in the transmission spectrum of HD189733b and HD209458b respectively.  More recently, using the narrowband tunable filter imager on the 10m GTC, \citet{Colon10} and \citet{Sing11} have detected the signature of potassium absorption in the atmospheres of HD80606b and XO-2b respectively. \\
\indent The discovery of additional bright transiting planet hosts is advantageous in enabling further the studies of the atmopsheric constituents of exoplanets. Our ongoing Transit Ephemeris Refinement and Monitoring Survey (TERMS, \citet{Kane09}) project focuses on bright stars (V$<10$) with known exoplanets on orbital periods greater than 10 days in an effort to refine the orbital parameters with additional radial velocity observations, and observe the targets photometrically in the revised transit window. If found, these planets would be perfect candidates for spectroscopic follow up, and the  period selection of greater than ten days ensures that the planet population searched by TERMS is not easily duplicatable by ground based transit surveys. In \citet{Kane11} we presented the emphemeris revision and  the search for a transit around HD156846. In this paper we present additional radial velocities that refine the ephemeris for the bright star HD168443 (which is known to have multiple companions) and present photometry ruling out the transit of HD168443b.

\section{HD168443}
\label{motivation}
HD168443 is a bright ($V=6.92$) G5 dwarf known to posses two substellar companions, forming a dynamically active system \citep{Veras07} . HD168443b \citep{Marcy99,Wright09} has a $msini=7.8\pm 0.259$ and a period of 58.11 days, as well as a significant eccentricty (e=0.53). HD168443c, a brown dwarf companion \citep{Udry02, Wright09}, has a  $msini=17.5\pm 0.585$ and a period of $\sim$1748 days, and a moderate eccentricity (e=0.21).  Using Hipparchos astrometry \citet{Reffert06} derived a mass of $37^{+36}_{-19}$ for HD168443c. Using the \citet{Leeuwen07} re-reduction of the Hipparchos data, \citet{Refferert11} derive a mass of $30.3^{9.4}_{-12.2}$, and a $3\sigma$ upper mass limit of $65M_{Jup}$ confirming that this object is indeed a brown dwarf.   The $3\sigma$  lower limit does not exclude an inclination of $90 \deg$, and the minimum derived from the radial velocities applies. Using CORALIE radial velocities and the \citet{Leeuwen07} Hipparcos re-reductions,  \citet{Sahlmann11} concluded that while their formal solution for the mass of HD168443c matched that of  \citet{Reffert11}, the mass was of low confidence. Dynamical simulations by \citet{Veras11} show that almost no stable systems can exist for relative inclinations between HD168443b and c of $60\deg-120\deg$.  The eccentric orbit of HD16884b increases its transit probability significantly beyond that one would expect for a in a circular orbit with the same period. Based on the known orbital parameters, and the formalism outlines in \citet{Kane09} we calculate that the a-priory transit probablility of HD168443b is {\bf3.8\%}. The host star is more than twice as bright as HD209458 (the brightest known transiting planet host), enabling transmission spectroscopy.  While the scale heights for massive, relatively cold planets are  expected to be small \citep{Madjar11}, the brightness of the star makes such detections possible with large ground based telescopes. Such studies are unlikely to be possible withought the discovery of transiting planets around bright stars. The discovery of a transit for the inner planet would also constrain the possible inclinations (and by extension mass) of the outer brown dwarf companion, enabling additional dynamical investigations.  \citet{Perryman11} have suggested that the HD168443 system could offer a powerful test of whether stellar activity is related to barycentric motion, a notion than has often been advanced to explain prolonged Maunder minima and solar activity cycles. Of the known bright dwarf stars hosting transiting planet hosts with periods greater than 10 days, HD168443 has the {\bf fifth} highest a-priori probability of a transiting planet. This coupled with the fact that it is very bright makes it an intriguing target in our ongoing attempts to discover such transiting planets.

\section{Hipparchos Photometry of HD168443}
The Hipparchos mission observed the brightest stars in the sky over many epochs. \citet{Robichon00} and \citet{Castellano00} detected the transit of HD209458b in the Hipparchos epoch photometry, and \citet{Hebrard06} were able to detect multiple transits of HD189733b, leading to a significant improvement in the determination of its period.  Hipparchos photometry has therefore been demonstrated to be precise enought to detect the transit of a Jupiter radii planet around stars fainter than HD168443 (V=6.92).  Figure \ref{fig:hip} shows the Hipparchos photometry and phasing on the known period for HD209458 and for the period we derived from long term radial velocity monitoring in section \ref{ephemeris} for HD168443. We follow the prescription of \citet{Robichon00} to create the phased plot. A long period planet, like HD168443b, has a significantly smaller probablilty (than a few day period hot Jupiter) of a Hipparchos observational epoch corresponding to a transit.

\section{Monitoring the Transit Window}
\subsection{CTIO Photometry}
\label{sec:photometry}

Since the PSF of the stars within each frame were non-gaussian in
shape, aperture photometry was used to measure each of the stars of
interest. For each star, a small part of the image ($\pm$~100 pixels
from the estimated center) was extracted from the frame. Estimates of
the extent of the PSF with suitable values for sky radii were then
passed to the photometry code for analysis. Due to the extreme
defocussing and stable guiding of the telescope, we found the
photometry to be relatively robust against the choice of these values.

As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:observing}, observing conditions on
the night of the transit window (2009 September 3) were not optimal
and plagued with thin cirrus. We were unfortunately unable to utilise
the bright reference stars in the alternate fields due to these
variable conditions. The difficulties imposed for this photometry thus
became dominated by the lack of bright reference stars within the 20
arcmin FOV. We selected the brightest four reference stars in the
frame which were $\sim 5$ magnitudes fainter than the target. Relative
photometry was performed using the methods described in \citet{eve01}.

\begin{figure}
 % \includegraphics[angle=270,width=8.2cm]{f03a.ps}
  %\includegraphics[angle=270,width=8.2cm]{f03b.ps}
  %\includegraphics[angle=270,width=8.2cm]{f03c.ps}
  \caption{CTIO photometry of HD~156846. Top: Data from 2009 September
    3 calibrated with four reference stars in the field, in which
    cloud effects are still present. Middle: Data from 2009 September
    3 calibrated with only the brightest reference star, corrected
    for airmass, and sigma-clipped. Bottom: For comparison, data from
    2009 September 9 using the same bright reference star and
    sigma-clipped, but no airmass correction is needed.}
  \label{fig:phot1}
\end{figure}

Shown in the top panel of Figure \ref{fig:phot1} is the lightcurve of
HD~156846 from the night of the transit window, calibrated using the
faint reference stars. The dip in the middle of the lightcurve is due
to cloud effects which are also present in the lightcurves of the
reference stars. The upward trend in the lightcurve is due to the
increasing airmass as the target was observed until it set. It was
found that only using the brightest reference star produced an
improved result in correcting for cloud effects. The lightcurve shown
in the middle panel of Figure \ref{fig:phot1} uses the brightest
reference star for calibration. A power law was applied to correct for
airmass, and a sigma-clip was performed to remove significant
outliers. The 1$\sigma$ scatter of the measurements in this panel is
slightly less than 1\%. For comparison, we show a lightcurve in the
bottom panel from the night of 2009 September 9 during which
conditions were significantly improved. This lightcurve uses the same
reference star but no airmass correction was needed or used. The
scatter is half that of the night of the transit window.
